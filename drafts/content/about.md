# About Hatamu Labs

Hatamu Labs is an automated software building laboratory where we build publicly and rapidly with AI. Vibe coding is making software building dirt cheap. We are pushing the limits of how rapidly we can iterate and ship real projects.

## Our Mission

We experiment across four dimensions:

**Speed:** How fast can we go from idea to working software?

**Scale:** How big and complex can the projects get?

**Concurrency:** How many projects can we build at once?

**Independence:** How hands-off can humans be?

## Philosophy

Every project is an experiment. Every line of code is data. We build in public and share what we learn.
